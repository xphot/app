This repository employs thought hypergraphs to detect and explain errors across experimental groups, integrating large language models (LLMs) for text analysis with causal inference techniques to uncover underlying patterns and dependencies in error occurrences.

### How to Use This Table

1. **Identify Key FMOps Dimensions**: Each row addresses a specific challenge (e.g., resource allocation, domain specialization, compliance).  
2. **Explanation Approach**: See how the system can become more transparent (e.g., “Critical Path Highlighting” for latency).  
3. **Hypergraphs of Thoughts**: Each row illustrates how a hypergraph-based structure clarifies decision flows among agents or model components, shining a light on intermediate steps, branching logic, and final outcomes.
