### How to Use This Table

1. **Identify Key FMOps Dimensions**: Each row addresses a specific challenge (e.g., resource allocation, domain specialization, compliance).  
2. **Explanation Approach**: See how the system can become more transparent (e.g., “Critical Path Highlighting” for latency).  
3. **Hypergraphs of Thoughts**: Each row illustrates how a hypergraph-based structure clarifies decision flows among agents or model components, shining a light on intermediate steps, branching logic, and final outcomes.
